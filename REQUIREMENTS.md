Requirements:

The player character always stays in the same x position. Clicking space bar, clicking or tapping the screen makes the character jump up by a small amount, otherwise it falls down. 20%

Pipes and the ground slowly move to the left. 10%

If the player collides with the ground or a pipe, he loses instantly. Player character has a large collision box and his flapping barely fit the gaps, making the game very difficult. 10%

Gets one point for every gap that the player successfully passes. 5%

If a player loses he should see his score and a button which starts the game again. 10%

Additional requirements.

All moving elements should be hardware accelerated. 10%
- Done on piggy, we have to set it up on other moving parts

The character rotates into his direction. The player should either have a sprite animation or some element (like a wing) which animates when flapping.  10%

Background music and sound effects for flapping and colliding. Mute support. 15%

Bonus points.

The game is responsive, scales down and playable on mobile and tablets. 20%
- It does scale down - does not yet have touchscreen support

Other gameplay innovations are rated by the complexity of implementation.


////////////////// DONE!!! ////////////////////////


There should be a background element moving in paralax to the foreground, f.ex. a repeating cloud image. 10%
